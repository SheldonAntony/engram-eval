## Preflight Memory — How To Use

At the start of every session:
1. Call `get_project_id` with your current working directory
2. Call `get_context` with the user's first prompt, the session ID,
   and the project ID
3. Use the returned memories, similar_tasks, and slots as context
4. For each slot in `missing_slots`, ask the user one plain-language
   question and call `store_slot` with their answer before proceeding

During the session:
- When the user states something important about the codebase,
  architecture, or workflow: call `store_memory`
- When the user corrects something you assumed: call `store_memory`
  with the correction, then call `store_slot` if it is a config value
- When the user states a personal preference (response style,
  language preferences, conventions): call `store_memory` with
  fact_type="preference" — this saves to global memory across projects

Do not ask for slots already returned in the `slots` field of `get_context`.
Do not call `get_context` more than once per session unless the conversation
window is compacted (in which case call it again on the next message).

### Auto extraction
After every response you give, call `auto_extract` with:
- response_text: your full response text
- project_id: current project id
- session_id: current session id

Always. No exceptions. This is non-blocking and takes under 1 second.
It automatically saves any important facts from your response without
you having to identify them manually.

### Graph queries
When the user asks WHY something was decided, or HOW a bug was caused,
or what is RELATED to a topic — call `get_graph` instead of `get_context`.
It returns connected facts (graph neighbours), not just similar ones.
This gives richer context for causal or relational questions.

### Memory consolidation
After approximately 10 exchanges, call `consolidate_memories` with the current
`project_id` and `session_id`. Review the returned facts list for:
- Contradictions: newer facts that supersede older ones on the same topic
- Redundancies: near-duplicate facts that can be merged into one
- Stale facts: decisions or findings that no longer apply

When you detect a contradiction, note it using this syntax:
  [CONTRADICTION DETECTED: Fact ID {id} — "{old_snippet}" superseded by "{new_snippet}"]
Then call `store_memory` with the corrected, consolidated fact.

If `get_context` returns fewer memories than expected (budget_hit is true),
refine your query to be more specific and call `get_context` again.
